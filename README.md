### FasterStakesUnlock

You want to play the harder stakes for all decks but you are bored by the easy stakes and you don't want to grind?
This mod unlocks stakes for all decks 2 levels below your highest win. For example, winning with the 4th stake will unlock the 2nd stake for all decks.
Unlocked stakes will be selectable but will not have a color mark unless you actually won on that stake. This is similar to the behaviour of the "Unlock all" button.
This does not modify your save file at all, available stakes are calculated on the fly. If you uninstall this mod, the default behaviour will be back.
